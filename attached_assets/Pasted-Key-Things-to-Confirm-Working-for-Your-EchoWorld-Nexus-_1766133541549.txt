Key Things to Confirm Working for Your EchoWorld Nexus Live Demo
With the VisaVerse deadline tomorrow (Dec 20, 2025), focus your testing on the core loop that showcases the problem-solving magic: Simulating financial shocks abroad to reduce anxiety around credit resets, PPP mismatches, and visa denials. Judges want a smooth, 2-3 min flow proving functionality, AI depth, and impact—without crashes or placeholders.
Prioritize these must-confirm elements (test in Streamlit locally/deployed; record a fallback video if live risks issues). I’ve grouped them by demo stage, with quick checks:
1. Onboarding & Data Input (Problem Setup – 20-30s Demo Time)
•  User Upload/Inputs: Confirm CSV spending upload or manual salary/savings/country selection works without errors. Test with sample data (e.g., $3k salary from Nigeria to Germany).
	•  Check: Enter invalid data (e.g., negative salary) – handles gracefully with errors?
•  Real Data Fetch (If Switched from Hardcoded): Verify API calls (World Bank for econ, ExchangeRate for currencies) succeed and populate dashboard. Fallback to mocks if offline.
	•  Check: Toggle PPP view – balance “shrinks” visually (e.g., $100 → €20 equiv) for that “aha!” moment.
•  Why Essential: Shows user-focused UX; ties to problem (e.g., “See how your home budget evaporates abroad”).
2. Simulation Run (Core AI/Fintech Magic – 1-2 Min Demo Time)
•  VTC Engine/API: Run a transaction sim (e.g., €1,200 rent) – shows approvals/declines with reasons (e.g., “Declined: Exceeds international limit”). If sandbox integrated, confirm mock fallback works.
	•  Check: 92% accuracy metric displays (vs. Visa rules); no API timeouts (test with/without key).
•  Monte Carlo Paths: Trigger 100-sim run – outputs top 1-2 forks with probs (e.g., “78% thriving if upskill”). Response time <2s.
	•  Check: Live “What if?” reroute (change salary → instant recalc); 85% hit rate on synthetic outcomes shows in stats.
•  Proof of Funds (PoF) Check: Integrates with visa data – flags if savings < threshold (e.g., below €11,904 for Germany → “Visa risk high”).
	•  Check: Compliance layer flags “high-risk” patterns (e.g., sanctioned-like tx).
•  RAG Confidence: Every output shows scores (e.g., 0.92) with guardrails (downgrade if Numbeo/World Bank variance >15%).
	•  Check: Hallucination-free – query “Berlin rent” pulls real/cross-verified data.
•  Why Essential: Proves AI meaningfulness; directly solves problem (e.g., “Preview visa denial before it happens”).
3. Outputs & Guidance (Emotional/Impact Close – 30-60s Demo Time)
•  Audio Guidance: Generates/plays TTS from “Financial Guardian” (e.g., “Hey, that rent almost declined—here’s the VTC fix”). Watermark included.
	•  Check: Neutral voice, no desync; fallback to text if audio fails.
•  Dashboard Visuals: Hero metrics (confidence %, PoF status, salary with PPP) update live; simple plots (no lagging Three.js).
	•  Check: Session state persists (e.g., change country → retains inputs).
•  Export/Roadmap: PDF generates with summary (VTC results, paths, recommendations) + QR to live demo.
	•  Check: NFT mint tease works (testnet tx hash displays, no gas errors).
•  Why Essential: Ties to optimism – shows empowerment over anxiety; judges love memorable outputs.
4. Ethics & Reliability (Throughout Demo)
•  Privacy/Disclaimers: No data stored (confirm session-only); watermarks/disclaimers visible (e.g., “Simulated tool”).
	•  Check: Delete-on-close verified (e.g., refresh clears state).
•  Fallbacks: All features work without keys (templates for AI, local for VTC/RAG).
	•  Check: Toggle demo mode – runs smoothly offline.
•  Why Essential: Disarms “creepy/gimmick” risks; shows responsibility for fintech.
Quick Testing Plan (Do This Today – 1-2 Hours)
•  Edge Cases: Invalid inputs, no internet, different countries (Germany/Japan first).
•  Metrics Validation: Run synthetic tests (e.g., known expat data) to confirm 92% VTC/85% Monte Carlo accuracy.
•  Demo Script: Practice: “Watch this €1,200 rent sim → Decline alert → PoF warning → Audio fix → Export.” Time under 3 mins.
•  Backup: If anything breaks (e.g., API rate limit), have hardcoded mode ready.
